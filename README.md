##Update CSS variables with inputs and Javascript.

Exercise 3/30, part of the [#Javascript30](http://javascript30.com) challenge.

Used this exercise to keep on practicing my Javascript skills. In this particular exercise, the main goal is to update the DOM with the event values the user decides to apply with some inputs. Also learned about the `dataset` property to access different HTML elements and looked over the `this` keyword.

- Javascript Vanilla
- Didn't actually do much to CSS3, but there it is.
